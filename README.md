This is a growing collection of code snippets that I have stumbled upon on the internet during my day-to-day coding,
many may have bugs, which are documented within the unit-tests. I try to write full tests for each snippet that I
add to make them more useful.

Where the source of a snippet is known it is documented in that methods docblock.

Feel free to fork and add your own additions, fix bugs, etc and push back.

If someone could show me how to test the path class with a mocked filesystem, that would be awesome ;)
